| AWS WAF (Web ACL) | [![launch][launch]][waf-latest] |

[waf-latest]: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/review?stackName=SupabaseWaf&templateURL=https://supabase-on-aws-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/SupabaseWaf.template.json

### Specification and Limitation

- APIs
  - All containers run on ECS Fargate (Graviton2).
  - All components are configured with AutoScaling.
  - GraphQL is not supported, because [pg_graphql](https://github.com/supabase/pg_graphql) is not supported with Amazon RDS/Aurora.
- Service Discovery
  - Each component is discovered as `***.supabase.internal`.
- Database (PostgreSQL)
  - [Amazon Aurora Serverless v2](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/) is used.
  - Todo: Add automatically password rotation.
- Supabase Studio
  - It is deployed on [Amplify Hosting](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/hosting/).
  - Todo: Add option to deploy the studio in different regions.
  - ⚠️ Warning: Supabase Studio is **open to web** and can be accessed by malicious actors. We **strongly** suggest you active ['Access control'](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/access-control.html) globaly and setup a strong password and username.

## Deploy via CDK

This cdk project has many resources for CloudFormation. **It is highly recomended to remove these resources for CloudFormation to use it as CDK**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mats16/supabase-on-aws.git

cd supabase-on-aws

yarn install

cdk deploy Supabase
```
